# Configuration

Cell looks for a config file in the working directory. It can be of JSON, TOML, YAML, HCL or Java properties format; the only requirement is that the file is called `cell.extension`, where extension can of course fit the format you're using. If an extension isn't provided, YAML will be used. This manual will use YAML.

## Examples

### cell.yml
```yaml
environment: release # Enables verbose logging (debug or release)
node: 0 #Â The ID of the node; only change this if you're scaling up
http:
    address: :8080 # The address to bind on
database:
    postgres: postgres://username:password@localhost/cell # A pg connection string
    redis:
        address: localhost:6379 # The Redis instance's address
        password: "" # The Redis password; leave empty if you haven't set one
        db: 0 # The Redis DB to use
sentry:
    dsn: https://00000000000000000000000000000000@0000000.ingest.sentry.io/0000000 # The optional Sentry DSN to use
